<h1>Why Choose Placeto CMS?</h1>
<p>Placeto CMS is not only developed by the modern website development firm, but has been used in hundreds of websites ranging from fortune 1000 companies to the start out business owner. To get a better understanding of why we started Placeto CMS and why it has become what it is today, you may like reading up on the <a href="./history.htm">History of Placeto CMS</a>.<p>
<p>We can't tell you every single reason why Placeto CMS fits your needs, but we can start by telling you what is important in the development of Placeto CMS.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Scalability</dt>
<dd>If you start your website off with Placeto CMS, as a small business owner, and you become an international franchise over night, Placeto CMS is ready for you. With Placeto CMS, it's very simple to switch servers or even adapt to a server cluster. Placeto CMS works with only a few small configuration changes and does not depend on any intergrated systems. Even if you decide to change your database type, it only takes a minute to switch systems.</dd>

<dt>Custimization</dt>
<dd>Placeto CMS is like dough, you can mold it in to anything you like. You can always make, add, or even remove features or design templates. Whatever you want your website too look like and do, it's all up to you.</dd>

<dt>Compatibility</dt>
<dd>Although Placeto CMS may only work on an Apache web server, the industry leading web server, Placeto is already written to support a slue of different Database platforms. We do recommend you use MySQL, but Placeto also supports: Oracle, PostgreSQL, Informix, SQLite, and we're always adding support for others as well.</dd>

<dt>Optimization</dt>
<dd>Optimization is a popular word in the world today, especially if you've ever heard of Search Engine Optimization. However, all that stuff out there may not be the correct or better way of doing things. When we optimize Placeto, we actually run benchmarks to see what does better and if we find a way to do something better and it works in our tests, we use it. We look at every single detail, which takes forever, and we are always asking our selfs if there is a better way of doing that particular thing.</dd>

<dt>Simplicity</dt>
<dd>We've been told that there is no possible way we can make Placeto CMS any easier to use. If you can use a computer, you can probably use Placeto. Not only is the adminstration and installtion side of Placeto fully automated and easy to use, but our development resource for template designers and module programmers is a piece of cake to learn and use.</dd>

<dt>Semantics</dt>
<dd>Being that Placeto CMS is developed by a web development firm, we know what's modern and the correct way of doing something. If there's a module or a template out there that's not semantic or does things in an ineffcient way, we don't publish it. Our strict line of ethics, have guidelines for even the tiniest of details that will benefit Placeto users.</dd>

<dt>Security</dt>
<dd>If someone ever tells you that they're software is impervious to being cracked, they're lieing. It's not if your web application can be hacked, it's how hard it is to do so. We won't admit our security is perfect, but we will tell you we jump on any flaw we find, the minute we hear about it. We even have ethical hacking experts who are always trying to crack Placeto's shell, to make sure Placeto is protected enough to go out in to the wild. We even provide our third party Module programmers with a security platform, to make sure they're not leaving holes open in the code they write.</dd>

<dt>Support</dt>
<dd>Being that Placeto CMS is an open-source and free application, makes it a little different than having commercial support. Like any good open-source application out there, there's always free community support out there somewhere. We go far enough to even offer you resources to ask questions or report problems, all for free. As long as there are people out there still using Placeto CMS, you will always find volenteers to help you.</dd>
