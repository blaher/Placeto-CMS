<h1>History</h1>
<p>Before we begin, we would like to point out that Placeto CMS is developed by <a href="http://www.blahertech.org">BlaherTech.org</a> and started by the developer Benjamin Jay Young. The history of both of these two and Placeto CMS are intertwined. Now let's begin, shall we?<p>
<p>In 2004, at the age of 13, Ben Young created a website to house several scripting projects he created for fun. He called this new website BlaherTeck, not knowing at the time he had mispelled it. As he created more and more small projects, he moved the website several times and eventually hosting the now called "BlaherTech" website on a server in his basement. By the 2006 had arrived, he had learned every aspect of running a web server and had started to learn a programming language called PHP.</p>
<p>Ben found it very time consuming to rewrite hundreds of files, for one simple design change. He eventually completed a website called BlaherTech 2.0, that was dynamically driven and made his editing a lot easier. One year later, he had started from scratch and programmed a platform to run the website, now called BlaherTech 3.0. Since all of his projects were open-source and free, he decided to release the platform under the name BTwww. By the time he was approaching the end of his High School career, he had already developed several websites for other people and competitions and had started making money off of a few of his large programming projects.</p>
<p>In 2009, Ben's programming experience and knowledge was at a career level and he already had been in a few working positions, designing and programming websites. Looking back on his BTwww project, it shamed him on how closed and poorly designed it was. Once again, he started from scratch, making sure this new CMS platform was as close to perfection. What he had just created, was the Alpha version of Placeto CMS, gaining it's name from a word that fell out of his mouth one day.</p>
<p>Shortly after in 2010, Ben had registered a small business called "<a href="http://www.blahertech.com">BlaherTech, LLC</a>", where he made profits off of building and hosting websites for small businesses. It was a step to help fund the BlaherTech.org project. Eventually, for the third time, after spending months of collecting of ideas for the perfect CMS for his business, he started from scratch again. Now Placeto CMS Beta being built, making sure that this new version was perfect for not only his clients to use, but for the developer and designers on his staff.</p>
<p>Following the development process, Ben found beta testers to help pinpoint all the problems that were hidden in Placeto CMS, moving on to the release candidates. Fine tweaking those small bugs, moving on to the stable release, Placeto CMS became what it is today.</p>
