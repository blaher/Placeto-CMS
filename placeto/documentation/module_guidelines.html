        <p>Here at <a href="http://www.blahertech.org">BlaherTech.org, we are very picky. In order to publish a module, we prefer you follow a few guidelines when writing your code. The majority of us come from an C background who all like the poetry of Java, but dislike the JVM. So try and write your code as if you were writing a Java poem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use PhpDoc, always and everywhere.</li>
            <li>We use NetBeans to develope Placeto, use what you want, but we will provide you with NetBean project files.</li>
            <li>We only accept open-source, specified by either the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a> or <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> foundations.</li>
            <li>Make sure to include the GPL statement, if using GPL.</li>
            <li>Do not leave any class function scope's unset (e.g. private, public, protected), same goes for class variables.</li>
            <li>Unset any variables when you're done with them.</li>
            <li>Programming style must be readable, we also prefer using the Allman style.</li>
            <li>Like drinking water, using comments is a healthy part of Placeto's diet.</li>
            <li>Use PDO to get SQL feedback, we provide you with an already running object.</li>
            <li>Do not directly concatinate anything in to SQL, append them with PDO Object::execute.</li>
            <li>Please use the security tools we provide you, whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Remember to give credit to yourself and your staff, where it can be applied.</li>
        </ul>
