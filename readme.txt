The Placeto CMS alpha release only consist of the engine and does not include an admin. To edit to content, you can use a database editor such as PHPMyAdmin and edit the table 'content' sorted by page names.

In order to install Placeto, just unextract the files somewhere on to your website. Go to the website URL you wish your users to view the pages (do not install locally, if you're setting up a public website) and go to the directory you put the files. Once there, Placeto will redirect to the proper installation script and will guide you the rest of the way.

Remember Placeto CMS is in alpha release only right now, we're still currently working on improving the engine and building the admin. Our goal is to provide the fastest CMS engine available and to release an extremely easy to use admin along with it. Please provide feedback and any bugs you may encounter at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/placeto.

Features:
* Easy Mod system (install in /inc/mods)
* Easy Template system (install in /inc/templates)
* Web cached enabled
* Gzip commpress support (disabled mod)

The Alpha releases consist of two files, the source .zip and the build .zip. The build .zip is the same as the source but whitespace, comments and file includes are removed for faster compression and sending. If you want to develop from the engine, a mod or a template, please use the source version. Otherwise for basic users, the build version will provide a optimal experience.
