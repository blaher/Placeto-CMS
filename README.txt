The Placeto CMS alpha release consists of the engine and a working draft of the admin. To edit to content, you may use the provided admin to edit simple content, but to use advanced features you can use a database editor such as PHPMyAdmin and edit the table 'content'.

In order to install Placeto, just unextract the files somewhere on to your website. Go to the website URL you wish your users to view the pages (do not install locally, if you're setting up a public website) and go to the directory you put the files. Once there, Placeto will redirect to the proper installation script and will guide you the rest of the way.

Remember Placeto CMS is in alpha release only right now, we're still currently working on improving the engine and planning features for the admin. Our goal is to provide the fastest CMS engine available and to release an extremely easy to use admin along with it. Please provide feedback and any bugs you may encounter at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/placeto.
